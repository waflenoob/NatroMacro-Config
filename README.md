## Collect

1) :star: [**Wealth Clock**](https://bee-swarm-simulator.fandom.com/wiki/Wealth_Clock) (tickets)
<br> Automatically enabled by default in Natro Macro's settings, so there's no reason as to why this would be disabled. Claims tickets from the Wealth Clock every hour after gathering.

<br> Every 8 hours, Natro Macro will attempt the Memory Match in the 35-bee zone, feel free to mix and match with the other Memory Match games.

3) :star: [**Glue Dispenser**](https://bee-swarm-simulator.fandom.com/wiki/Glue_Dispenser) (glue)
<br> Allows you to collect free glue from the [**Gummy Lair**](https://bee-swarm-simulator.fandom.com/wiki/Gummy_Bear%27s_Lair) every 22 hours, the amount depends on your Goo badge.

## Kill

### Bug Runs

Bug Runs are useful when it comes to potentially collecting good loot, battle points, etc.
When enabling Bug Runs in Natro Macro, it's recommended to **select all** and **disable allow gather interupt**.

If you have any buffs which effect monster respawn time, enter them in the **Monster Respawn Time** section.
